# cl-rsa

## Description
Common Lisp implementation of the asymmetric encryption algorithm RSA.

This was my final project for the subject "Programming Paradigms IV" in University. This work along with an article ("Programaci√≥n Funcional, RSA y Firmas Digitales con Lisp") were accepted and published in Argentina's National Congress of Computer Engineering / Information Systems (CoNaIISI) 2022.

## Running the executable binary

Download the latest release and run `rsa`:

<pre><code>$ ./rsa (key length in bits) </code></pre>

Example:

<pre><code>$ ./rsa 1024 </code></pre>

## Recommendation
**It is recommended you choose one of the following key lengths:**

* 512
* 1024
* 1536
* 2048

These key lengths are covered in NIST FIPS 186-5 and they have explicitly coded the necessary rounds of miller rabin test to guarantee a probability error of 2^-100.

## Running the script from source
### You will need:
* [Roswell](https://roswell.github.io/Home.html): Common Lisp environment setup Utility - with [SBCL](https://www.sbcl.org/)

### To run the script:

Clone the repository:

<pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/joelcanepa/lisp-rsa.git</code></pre>

Run `rsa.ros`:

<pre><code>$ ./rsa.ros (key length in bits) </code></pre>

Example:

<pre><code>$ ./rsa.ros 1024 </code></pre>

# Dependecies

The project includes some open source packages, with modifications to fit the project's needs, to deal wih modular arithmetic and the miller rabin test:

* [cl-rsm-mod](https://sources.debian.org/src/cl-rsm-mod/1.4/mod.lisp/)
* cl-primality
* [LisPrime - coprime.lisp](https://github.com/dradisavljevic/LisPrime/blob/master/coprime.lisp)
